# About this certificate
This program consists of 6 courses providing me with solid theoretical understanding and considerable practice of the main algorithms, uses, and best practices related to Machine Learning. This Professional Certificate has a strong emphasis on developing the skills that help me advance a career in Machine Learning. All the courses include a series of hands-on labs and final projects. Throughout this Professional Certificate, I gained exposure to a series of tools, libraries, cloud services, datasets, algorithms, assignments and projects that provided me with practical skills with applicability to Machine Learning jobs. These skills include:

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks and Watson Studio

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, Keras, and TensorFlow.
