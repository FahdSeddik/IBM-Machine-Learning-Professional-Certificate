# [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning)

This repo consists of my lab solutions, projects, and notebooks for IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate on Coursera. 


# About the certificate
The IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate consists of 6 courses that provide solid theoretical understanding and considerable practice of the main algorithms, uses, and best practices related to Machine Learning. The Professional Certificate has a strong emphasis on developing the skills that help advance a career in Machine Learning. All the courses include a series of hands-on labs and final projects.  
  
Throughout this Professional Certificate, I gained exposure to a series of tools, libraries, cloud services, datasets, algorithms, assignments and projects that provide practical skills with applicability to Machine Learning jobs. These skills include:
- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks and Watson Studio
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, Keras, and TensorFlow.
